          <p>
            Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, one woman I highly adore. 
            She is the World Trade Organization's first female and first African director-general, She is also a Nigerian economist who took office on March 3, 2021. (WTO). She oversaw efforts at the World Bank that gave low-income nations' economies priority and was also the finance minister of Nigeria for the longest period of time.
            Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was born in Ogwashi-Ukwu, Delta State, Nigeria, on June 13, 1954. When she was a teenager, she went to the United States to study at Harvard University after attending the oldest girls' secondary school in Nigeria.
            Here's one of her quotes that I particularly like:
        </p>
        <div id="quote">
        <blockquote style="color: whitesmoke;">
           <br> "Africa is a continent of many countries, not one country.
            <br> If we are down to three or four conflicts, 
           <br> it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable, 
           <br> growing, exciting economies where there's plenty of opportunity."
             </blockquote>
